# How Do You Know What Programming or Technology Methods Work Best?

What makes the difference between amateur, professional, and elite level coding/tech? Error free, efficient, secure, and mass access techology.

## Who Sets the Standards for Technology?

### International Bodies

* ISO (International Organization for Standardization). Cross-industry standards including quality, environment, and information security.
* IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission). Electrical, electronic, and related technologies.
* ITU (International Telecommunication Union). Telecommunications and ICT, including radio spectrum and networks.
* ISO and IEC also run a joint committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1, which oversees many information technology standards.

### Regional Bodies

* ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute). ICT in Europe, including cellular and radio systems.
* CEN and CENELEC. Broad European standards and electrotechnical standards that often align with ISO and IEC work.

### National Standards Bodies & Agencies

* ANSI (United States). Coordinates national standards and represents the U.S. in ISO.
* BSI (United Kingdom), DIN (Germany), AFNOR (France), JISC or JSA (Japan), SAC (China). National counterparts to ISO and IEC.
* NIST (U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology). Government agency that issues standards and guidance, especially in cybersecurity and measurement science.

### Professional Societies & Engineering Institutes

* IEEE. Widely used electrical and electronic standards such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi (IEEE 802 family).
* SAE International, ASME, ASTM. Sector specific engineering standards.

### Internet & Web Standard Bodies

* IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). Internet protocols such as TCP, IP, TLS, and HTTP.
* W3C (World Wide Web Consortium). Web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and accessibility guidance.
* ICANN. Coordinates internet domain names and IP address allocation policy.

### Industry Alliances & Consortia

* 3GPP. Mobile telecommunications specifications including 4G LTE and 5G.
* Bluetooth SIG. Bluetooth specifications and certification.
* USB-IF. USB specifications and compliance testing.
* PCI SSC. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards.
* FIDO Alliance and OpenID Foundation. Authentication and identity standards.
* Khronos Group and OASIS. Graphics, compute, and enterprise interoperability specifications.

### Testing & Certification Organizations

* UL, TÜV, CSA Group, Intertek. Safety testing, conformance, and certification that reference formal standards.

### De Facto Standards From Market Adoption

* Some technologies become standards through widespread use and vendor ecosystems even without a formal standards body approval. Examples include certain file formats, programming frameworks, and cloud APIs.

### How They Fit Together

* Many standards are voluntary and developed by consensus. Governments and regulators may later reference them in laws or procurement rules.
* National bodies participate in ISO and IEC committees. Regional bodies often adopt or adapt international work to their markets.
* Conformance programs from alliances and testing labs ensure that products implement the specifications correctly.
