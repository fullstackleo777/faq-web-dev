# What Matters In A Hosting Environment AKA Tech Stack AKA System Architecture?

As the project stakeholder and/or person in charge of the hosting and serving of a website or multiple websites, you need to make many decisions that affect the security, availability, and performance of your overall hosting environment AKA tech stack AKA system architecture.

***NOTE!!! Hosing Environment, Tech Stack, and System Architecture are commonly mistaken as the same thing but they are actually 3 different ideas and/or considerations that come together like a 3-layer cake.***
